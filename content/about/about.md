# Hack The Planet!

So I have finally decided to join the ranks of web developers, ditching the previous notion of using bloated dynamic sites (I'm looking at you WordPress), I have circum to suckless web development and I can finally focus on writing instead of having to centre divs.

If you don't already know me, I am Vlad. I like computers, this website will serve as a repository for my personal notes and explorations into the vast and vastly exciting world of computer science, and beyond! 

Things to expect:
  - AI art
  - Algorithms reviews 
  - CTF walkthroughs
  - Random rants
  - Skateboard tricks
  - Some Photos
  - Tool tutorials
  - Top lists

The primary objective of this project is to enhance the quality of my work and elevate my hacking skills. By being hosted on a public domain website, it adds more structure to my work due to social accountability. Additionally, Hugo has significantly reduced the entry barrier for writing blog posts. As I no longer need to leave the comfort of the command line, I find writing more enjoyable.
